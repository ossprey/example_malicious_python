# Example malicious package

This is an example malicious package that demonstrates how attackers might attempt to compromise a seemingly innoculous package.

This is used for testing and demonstration purposes only and is completely benign.

In the __init__.py file you will see some sample code that will base64 decode and run a command which will echo to the screen echo "You got pwned!"

This is all it does.
